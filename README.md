  ii. Click on the create application.
  iii. Give an application a name, select Node.js platform.
  iv. Click Create, with Application code as Sample application.
4. Go to CodePipeline service to create a pipeline for this application.

  ii. Give a name to your pipeline and click next.
  iii. From the source provider select GitHub and connect it to this console.
  iv. Then select the repository you want to deploy and the branch of it.
  v. After configuring these click the next button.
  vi. Then itâ€™ll ask for add build stage (skipped here).
5. Now add where to deploy this code. Before this,confirm that the EBS environment is ready to deploy the application.
6. Now go to CodePipeline console to deploy the application.
